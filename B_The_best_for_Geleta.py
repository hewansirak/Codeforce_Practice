# After receiving yet another integer array a1,a2,…,anat her birthday party, 
# Geleta decides to perform some operations on it.

# Formally, there are m operations that he is going to perform in order. 
# Each of them belongs to one of the two types:
#  + l r Given two integers l and r, for all 1≤i≤n such that l≤ai≤r, set ai:=ai+1
#  - l r Given two integers l and r, for all 1≤i≤n such that l≤ai≤r, set ai:=ai−1

# For example, if the initial array a=[7,1,3,4,3], after performing the operation + 2 4, 
# the array a=[7,1,4,5,4]. Then, after performing the operation - 1 10, 
# the array a=[6,0,3,4,3].

# Geleta is curious about the maximum value in the array a. Please help him find it after each of the m operations.
